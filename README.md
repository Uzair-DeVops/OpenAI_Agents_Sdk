## Introduction

In Lecture 2, we expand on the foundation established in Lecture 1 by introducing asynchronous programming within the context of AI agents. You will learn how to leverage asynchronous operations to improve the performance and responsiveness of your agents, as well as techniques for handling streaming data. The session covers:

- Asynchronous programming fundamentals.
- Implementing asynchronous agents with the OpenAI Agent SDK.
- Understanding and handling streaming data responses.
- Comparing synchronous and asynchronous agent performance.

---

## Lecture Overview

**Topics Covered:**

- **Asynchronous Programming Concepts:**  
  An overview of asynchronous programming principles, including the event loop, tasks, and coroutines. This section explains how async functionality can help manage I/O-bound tasks without blocking the execution flow.

- **Async Agent Implementation:**  
  Detailed walkthroughs of files such as `async_agent.py` and `async_concepts.py` demonstrate how to implement asynchronous behaviors in agent operations.

- **Streaming Data with AI Agents:**  
  The lecture introduces `streaming_agent.py`, which shows how to process streaming data in real time, allowing your agent to output results as they become available.

- **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Agents:**  
  The code in `simple_agent.py` contrasts the basic synchronous agent implementation with the asynchronous approach, highlighting benefits like improved responsiveness and resource efficiency.
